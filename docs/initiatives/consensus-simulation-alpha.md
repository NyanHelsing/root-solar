# Consensus Simulation Alpha

## Objective
Deliver an interactive lab where strategists can model the impact of proposed axioms or sentiment shifts, validating the feasibility of predictive governance tooling.

## Key Outcomes
- Scenario engine capable of running parameterized simulations (participation rates, sentiment elasticity, external shocks).
- Visualization suite that animates consensus diffusion and flags high-risk friction points.
- Reporting workflow that exports scenario assumptions, confidence bands, and recommended interventions for stakeholders.

## Workstreams
1. **Model Architecture** – Build core simulation models using historical sentiment data and configurable behavioral coefficients.
2. **Interface & Controls** – Develop UI controls for crafting scenarios, adjusting parameters, and comparing outcomes.
3. **Result Narratives** – Automate generation of executive-readable summaries with clear action steps and risk disclosures.
4. **Validation Loop** – Partner with two governance teams to run real-world scenarios, cross-check predictions against actual outcomes, and refine models.

## Dependencies
- Access to sanitized historical sentiment data and event logs to calibrate baseline models.
- Compute budget for running simulations, including potential need for parallel processing or serverless jobs.
- Collaboration with data science advisors to validate modeling assumptions and avoid bias amplification.

## Success Metrics
- Simulations delivered with median runtime under 90 seconds for standard scenario complexity.
- Pilot teams report ≥60% alignment between predicted and observed consensus shifts within one month.
- At least one external organization incorporates simulation reports into formal decision rituals.
