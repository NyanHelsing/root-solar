# Agent Cohort Framework

## Objective
Enable autonomous agents to form, execute, and report on mission-driven cohorts that align with root.solar axioms while keeping human stewards in the loop.

## Key Outcomes
- Cohort configuration schema capturing mission, required axioms, guardrails, and telemetry endpoints.
- Scheduling and matching service that assigns eligible agents to cohorts based on availability and sentiment-weighted urgency.
- Compliance dashboard showing adherence scores, action logs, and escalation triggers for human oversight.

## Workstreams
1. **Cohort Schema Design** – Define SurrealDB tables for `cohort`, `cohort_membership`, and `cohort_run` with constraint validation.
2. **Agent Integration Protocol** – Extend the TRPC API with cohort enrollment, task assignment, and status reporting endpoints.
3. **Governance Guardrails** – Implement rule evaluation that halts or reroutes cohorts when actions would violate selected axioms.
4. **Oversight UI** – Deliver monitoring views for stewards to approve cohorts, inspect decisions, and intervene when needed.

## Dependencies
- Inventory of target agent platforms and authentication handshake requirements.
- Security review for agent action scopes and data exposure.
- Capacity from the network team to extend protocol readiness indicators for cohort-specific telemetry.

## Success Metrics
- Launch of at least two autonomous cohorts completing defined missions without human micromanagement.
- 100% of cohort actions traceable back to originating axioms and authorization decisions.
- Time to intervention for flagged violations reduced below 5 minutes via oversight tooling.
