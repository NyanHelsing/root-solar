# Credential Ledger MVP

## Objective
Launch a verifiable credentialing system that recognizes meaningful contributions to the root.solar canon and powers reputation-aware coordination.

## Key Outcomes
- Credential taxonomy covering authorship, stewardship, mediation, and sentiment reliability issued through a signed ledger.
- Wallet-compatible verification endpoints so beings and partner systems can validate credentials without exposing sensitive data.
- Client-side recognition surfaces (badges, profile summaries) that leverage credentials to route trust and responsibilities.

## Workstreams
1. **Credential Schema & Issuance** – Define credential structures, revocation policies, and automated issuance flows tied to SurrealDB events.
2. **Verification Infrastructure** – Stand up verification APIs, DID methods, or alternative identifiers to prove credential authenticity.
3. **Experience Integration** – Update being profiles and governance workflows to consume credentials when allocating rights or tasks.
4. **Pilot Recognition Loop** – Run a targeted rewards program (e.g., steward stipend) to validate behavioral impact of credentialing.

## Dependencies
- Choice of decentralized identity stack or signature standard aligned with partner expectations.
- Legal assessment of data retention and consent requirements for contribution tracking.
- Collaboration with design to visualize badges and trust tiers effectively.

## Success Metrics
- Issue ≥100 credentials across at least three categories within the first release window.
- 60% of cohort allocation decisions referencing credentials as part of qualification checks.
- Measurable increase in repeat contributions (target +25%) from credential recipients over baseline.
