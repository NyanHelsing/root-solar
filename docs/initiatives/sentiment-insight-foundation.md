# Sentiment Insight Foundation

## Objective
Establish the data infrastructure and analytical loops required to transform raw sentiment allocations into actionable intelligence for coordinators, beings, and partner systems.

## Key Outcomes
- Unified telemetry pipeline that streams sentiment mutations from SurrealDB into an analytics-ready store within five minutes of change.
- First-generation insight surfaces: heatmap dashboards, trend deltas, and network pulse notifications embedded in the client UI.
- External webhook/API endpoints that broadcast consensus signals to downstream automation consumers.

## Workstreams
1. **Event Stream Capture** – Introduce change data capture hooks for `sentiment` records, buffer in queue, and persist to a columnar analytics table.
2. **Insight Modeling** – Design sentiment trend models (7/30-day deltas, variance, threshold breaches) and expose through a TRPC analytics router.
3. **Experience Integration** – Ship a React experience that visualizes emergent clusters and delivers configurable alerts.
4. **Partner Hooks** – Publish public schema and registerable webhooks so ecosystem tools can subscribe to consensus telemetry.

## Dependencies
- SurrealDB hooks or scheduled polling to detect sentiment mutations.
- Observability stack capacity for streaming metrics (consider extending @root-solar/observability).
- Frontend design bandwidth to incorporate dashboards without derailing the existing layout.

## Success Metrics
- ≥80% of mutation events processed and reflected in dashboards within 180 seconds.
- At least three partner systems actively consuming webhook feeds within the first quarter post-launch.
- Reported reduction in manual status requests from coordinators by 50% after rollout.
