# Federation Readiness Program

## Objective
Prepare root.solar to safely federate principles and sentiment data with external governance networks by standing up interoperability standards, compliance infrastructure, and partner onboarding playbooks.

## Key Outcomes
- Versioned schema negotiation protocol with automated compatibility checks and lineage tracking.
- Edge service that publishes and consumes signed axiom updates, complete with receipt verification and rollback mechanics.
- Partner acceleration kit containing legal templates, technical SDKs, and operational procedures for federation trials.

## Workstreams
1. **Schema Harmonization** – Define mapping DSL, conflict resolution heuristics, and automated validation tooling for cross-network schema sync.
2. **Secure Sync Fabric** – Build event streaming services with signature verification, retry policies, and audit logs for every federated transaction.
3. **Partner Enablement** – Develop documentation, sample code, and guided workshops that shepherd early federated partners from zero to live sync.
4. **Governance Alignment** – Codify agreements covering data retention, escalation paths, and exit strategies; secure approval from legal/ethics boards.

## Dependencies
- Cryptographic primitives from the observability/infra stack to sign and verify cross-network payloads.
- Integration bandwidth from at least two willing partner organizations.
- Budget for compliance review and potential third-party security assessments.

## Success Metrics
- Two federation pilots exchanging axiom and sentiment updates with <1 minute replication lag.
- Zero critical sync incidents during the pilot window as evidenced by audit log reviews.
- Partner NPS ≥ 50 for onboarding experience and documentation quality.
