# Roadmap Horizons

## Near-Term (0–3 months)
- `docs/initiatives/sentiment-insight-foundation.md` — Foundational telemetry and analytics unlock the insight surfaces that every other initiative depends on; scoped to fit within current SurrealDB and UI patterns.
- `docs/initiatives/axiom-origination-pilot.md` — Fast feedback from guided drafting pilots informs schema extensions and experience design before broader investments.

## Mid-Term (3–6 months)
- `docs/initiatives/credential-ledger-mvp.md` — Builds on the richer provenance data produced by the origination pilot and requires the sentiment pipeline to trigger issuance events.
- `docs/initiatives/agent-cohort-framework.md` — Needs sentiment signals and credential gating to safely enroll autonomous agents while remaining feasible once near-term groundwork lands.

## Long-Term (6–12 months)
- `docs/initiatives/federation-readiness-program.md` — External federation depends on mature credentials, stable schemas, and proven operational processes; schedule after internal systems harden.
- `docs/initiatives/consensus-simulation-alpha.md` — Predictive simulations demand historical telemetry, cross-network data, and validated behavioral models, making it the capstone once earlier initiatives supply the necessary signal density.
