# Epic: Cohort Guardrail Engine

## Summary
Build a policy evaluation layer that checks agent intentions against cohort axioms, credential requirements, and risk thresholds before actions execute.

## Deliverables
- Rule engine capable of evaluating proposed actions with deterministic allow/deny/needs-review outcomes.
- Policy authoring interface for stewards to define guardrails using a declarative syntax.
- Real-time enforcement hooks integrated with cohort APIs and agent callbacks.

## Key Dependencies
- Credential verification services to confirm agent eligibility.
- Governance policy inputs outlining prohibited actions, escalation triggers, and exception handling.
- Observability pipelines for logging decisions and enabling audits.

## Milestones & Exit Criteria
1. **Policy Language Spec** – Define DSL or configuration format; validate expressiveness with governance team.
2. **Simulation Harness** – Test guardrail decisions against historical scenarios; measure false positives/negatives.
3. **Live Enforcement** – Guardrail engine running in production with automated alerts on overrides; maintain <1% false block rate.
