# Epic: Simulation Reporting Suite

## Summary
Produce narrative-ready outputs that translate simulation results into clear action recommendations, confidence bands, and risk disclosures for decision makers.

## Deliverables
- Report generator that synthesizes model outputs into executive summaries, key metrics, and visualizations.
- Export options (PDF, Markdown, API) enabling distribution across governance channels and partner tools.
- Traceability links tying recommendations back to underlying assumptions and data sources.

## Key Dependencies
- Scenario builder to supply structured simulation inputs and metadata.
- Design/communications support to craft digestible narratives and visual styles.
- Permissions model ensuring sensitive reports are scoped appropriately.

## Milestones & Exit Criteria
1. **Template Library** – Define standard report sections and visual components; validate with steering committee.
2. **Automation Beta** – Reports generated automatically post-simulation with manual editing hooks for reviewers.
3. **Adoption Gate** – At least one governance body uses reports in formal decision rituals; gather feedback for iteration.
