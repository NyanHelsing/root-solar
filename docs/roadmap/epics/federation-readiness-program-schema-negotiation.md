# Epic: Federation Schema Negotiation

## Summary
Create tooling and processes that map external doctrine schemas to root.solar’s axiom and sentiment models with version control and conflict resolution.

## Deliverables
- Mapping DSL and validator that translate partner schemas into canonical root.solar structures.
- Diff tooling that highlights breaking changes, proposes resolutions, and maintains lineage history.
- Governance workflow for approving schema merges, including review queues and automated checks.

## Key Dependencies
- Input from partner engineers to capture real schema edge cases.
- Storage for versioned mappings and metadata with auditability.
- Collaboration with legal/compliance on data classification impacts.

## Milestones & Exit Criteria
1. **DSL Prototype** – Demonstrate mapping of at least two partner schemas in staging with unit tests.
2. **Review Workflow** – Implement approval lifecycle in tooling; reviewers can annotate and request changes.
3. **Production Adoption** – First external partner syncing via negotiated schema with zero critical mapping errors over a month.
