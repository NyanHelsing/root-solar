# Epic: Simulation Validation Program

## Summary
Run structured validation campaigns comparing simulation predictions with real-world outcomes to tune accuracy, build trust, and identify model gaps.

## Deliverables
- Pilot program charter identifying partner governance teams, evaluation windows, and measurement criteria.
- Instrumentation capturing actual post-decision sentiment shifts and comparing them to predicted ranges.
- Retrospective reports documenting discrepancies, root causes, and prioritized model improvements.

## Key Dependencies
- Simulation reports integrated into partner decision workflows.
- Access to near-real-time sentiment telemetry for post-event measurement.
- Dedicated data science and product resources to analyze results and adjust models.

## Milestones & Exit Criteria
1. **Program Kickoff** – Secure commitments from at least two governance teams to participate in validation cycles.
2. **Observation Window** – Complete multiple decision cycles, capturing before/after sentiment data and qualitative insights.
3. **Model Iteration** – Implement refinements reducing prediction error by ≥20% and document updated calibration methods.
