# Epic: Federation Operational Governance

## Summary
Codify shared operating procedures, escalation paths, and stewardship roles that keep federated networks aligned and resilient under change.

## Deliverables
- Joint governance charter defining decision rights, change management steps, and dispute resolution mechanisms.
- RACI matrix and communication plan for routine operations, incidents, and roadmap updates.
- Performance scorecards monitoring federation KPIs (uptime, sync accuracy, partner satisfaction) with quarterly reviews.

## Key Dependencies
- Buy-in from internal leadership and partner representatives to formalize joint governance.
- Data streams from sync fabric and partner telemetry for KPI tracking.
- Collaboration tools (shared workspaces, dashboards) accessible across organizations.

## Milestones & Exit Criteria
1. **Charter Workshop** – Facilitate multi-party workshop to draft governance charter; secure provisional agreement.
2. **Operational Kickoff** – Establish recurring governance ceremonies and publish shared dashboards.
3. **Quarterly Review** – Complete first review cycle, implement corrective actions, and document lessons learned.
