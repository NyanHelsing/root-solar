# Epic: Federation Sync Fabric

## Summary
Build the secure, event-driven transport that publishes and consumes signed axiom and sentiment updates across federated networks with low latency and reliability guarantees.

## Deliverables
- Edge service for outbound events with signature envelopes, retry policies, and delivery receipts.
- Inbound listener that validates signatures, deduplicates events, and applies updates idempotently.
- Observability dashboards tracking replication lag, failure rates, and partner-specific health metrics.

## Key Dependencies
- Credential/identity infrastructure for key management and signature verification.
- Partner staging environments to run integration tests and chaos scenarios.
- Incident response processes shared with partners for coordinated recovery.

## Milestones & Exit Criteria
1. **Transport Alpha** – Secure channel established between root.solar staging and a partner sandbox.
2. **Reliability Trials** – Execute fault injection tests demonstrating recovery within defined SLAs.
3. **Pilot Launch** – Live replication with <60s lag and zero data integrity incidents for two consecutive sprints.
