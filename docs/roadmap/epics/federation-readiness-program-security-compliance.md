# Epic: Federation Security & Compliance

## Summary
Establish the security controls, auditing, and contractual frameworks that govern cross-network data exchange and satisfy regulatory requirements.

## Deliverables
- Threat modeling and risk assessments tailored to federation scenarios, with mitigation plans tracked to completion.
- Compliance artefacts (DPAs, SLAs, escalation playbooks) aligned with legal guidance and partner expectations.
- Continuous monitoring for anomalous federation activity with automated alerting and response protocols.

## Key Dependencies
- Collaboration with legal, security, and compliance teams to draft enforceable agreements.
- Telemetry from the sync fabric for monitoring and forensic analysis.
- Budget for third-party security reviews or penetration testing as required.

## Milestones & Exit Criteria
1. **Risk Register** – Document prioritized risks with owners and mitigation timelines.
2. **Control Implementation** – Deploy required security controls (encryption, access management, logging) and validate via audits.
3. **Certification Gate** – Achieve internal compliance sign-off and, if needed, third-party attestation before production federation.
