# Epic: Credential Experience Integration

## Summary
Surface credentials inside the root.solar client and governance workflows so recognition translates into trust routing and operational impact.

## Deliverables
- Updated being profiles with credential badges, timelines, and verification status indicators.
- Governance workflow hooks that enforce credential checks for cohort enrollment, approvals, or elevated permissions.
- User education materials explaining credential value, acquisition paths, and privacy settings.

- Verification layer APIs to fetch credential status securely.
- Design system updates for badge styles, tooltips, and modal interactions.
- Coordination with agent cohort and governance teams to integrate credential gating logic.

## Milestones & Exit Criteria
1. **UX Validation** – Conduct usability tests on mockups; iterate to reduce comprehension friction.
2. **Feature Pilot** – Enable badge views for internal users; monitor performance and data accuracy.
3. **Workflow Adoption** – At least two governance processes rely on credential checks with documented outcomes.
