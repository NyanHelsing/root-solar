# Epic: Origination Collaboration Canvas

## Summary
Ship a multiplayer drafting surface that structures axiom creation into guided sections, enabling synchronous and asynchronous collaboration without losing context.

## Deliverables
- Real-time co-editing UI with presence indicators, section locks, and version history snapshots.
- Structured templates for principle statement, rationale, dissent, and decision log fields.
- Autosave and conflict resolution logic resilient to intermittent connectivity.

## Key Dependencies
- Design system support for new collaboration components (avatars, cursors, timeline controls).
- Websocket or WebRTC infrastructure to broadcast edits and presence events.
- QA capacity to stress-test collaborative edge cases and reconcile merges.

## Milestones & Exit Criteria
1. **Prototype Review** – Internal stakeholders validate usability via clickable prototype or feature flag preview.
2. **Functional Beta** – Canvas handles at least 10 simultaneous collaborators with <200ms update latency.
3. **Stability Gate** – Run load and resilience tests; zero critical defects during two pilot sessions.
