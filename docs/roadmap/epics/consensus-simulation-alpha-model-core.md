# Epic: Simulation Model Core

## Summary
Develop the foundational models that simulate sentiment diffusion, participation behavior, and external shocks using historical telemetry and configurable parameters.

## Deliverables
- Data pipelines that assemble training datasets from sentiment logs, cohort outcomes, and network events.
- Parameterized models supporting adjustable participation rates, elasticity coefficients, and shock inputs.
- Calibration tooling to fine-tune models against historical scenarios with reproducible results.

## Key Dependencies
- Access to sanitized historical sentiment and network data from the analytics platform.
- Data science expertise to validate model selection and avoid bias amplification.
- Compute resources for experimentation, including batch jobs or serverless workers.

## Milestones & Exit Criteria
1. **Model Specification** – Document chosen modeling approaches and validation methodology; secure stakeholder buy-in.
2. **Calibration Pass** – Achieve target accuracy against known historical events (e.g., ±10% error on consensus shifts).
3. **Runtime SLA** – Optimize to meet <90 second runtime for standard scenarios with instrumentation in place.
