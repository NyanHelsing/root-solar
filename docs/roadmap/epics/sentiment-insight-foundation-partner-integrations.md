# Epic: Sentiment Partner Integrations

## Summary
Expose consensus telemetry to ecosystem partners through secure webhooks and SDKs so external tools can act on live sentiment signals.

## Deliverables
- Webhook registration service with scoped subscriptions, retry policies, and signed payloads.
- Partner SDK snippets (TypeScript, Python) that demonstrate consuming sentiment events and verifying signatures.
- Governance guidelines covering acceptable use, rate limits, and incident response expectations.

## Key Dependencies
- Analytics engine providing normalized payloads ready for external consumption.
- Security review for payload structure, authentication, and abuse mitigation.
- Legal approval for data sharing terms included in partner agreements.

## Milestones & Exit Criteria
1. **Developer Preview** – Webhook service live in staging; sample apps receive test payloads end-to-end.
2. **Pilot Partner Launch** – Onboard at least three partners, monitor delivery latency, and gather integration feedback.
3. **Operationalization** – Publish public documentation, support SLAs, and hand off to partner success with playbooks.
