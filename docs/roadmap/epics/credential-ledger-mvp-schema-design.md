# Epic: Credential Schema Design

## Summary
Define credential categories, issuance criteria, and revocation policies that reflect meaningful contributions to root.solar while satisfying regulatory and ethical expectations.

## Deliverables
- Credential taxonomy covering authorship, stewardship, mediation, and sentiment reliability use cases.
- Policy documentation for issuance triggers, expiration, revocation, and dispute resolution.
- Data contracts aligning SurrealDB events with credential claims and metadata fields.

## Key Dependencies
- Input from governance, legal, and community ops to ensure legitimacy and compliance.
- Access to sentiment and origination event schemas for mapping contribution signals.
- Stakeholder workshops to align on incentive design and risk mitigation.

## Milestones & Exit Criteria
1. **Draft Taxonomy** – Circulate initial schema proposals for feedback; capture decisions in shared documentation.
2. **Policy Ratification** – Governance council formally approves issuance/revocation rules.
3. **Implementation Readiness** – Engineering sign-off confirming schemas and policies are build-ready with traceability.
