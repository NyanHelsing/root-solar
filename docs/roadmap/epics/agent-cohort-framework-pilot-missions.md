# Epic: Cohort Pilot Missions

## Summary
Run supervised missions with autonomous agents to validate cohort flows, guardrails, and oversight capabilities before wide release.

## Deliverables
- Mission catalog outlining objectives, success metrics, and safety constraints for pilot cohorts.
- Execution playbooks coordinating agent onboarding, steward roles, and escalation procedures.
- Post-mission retrospectives documenting outcomes, incidents, and improvement backlog.

## Key Dependencies
- Cohort APIs, guardrails, and oversight tooling at production readiness behind feature flags.
- Credential ledger integration to vet participating agents and stewards.
- Community partners willing to sponsor real-world mission scenarios.

## Milestones & Exit Criteria
1. **Mission Readiness** – Select at least two pilot missions with clearly defined KPIs and approval from governance council.
2. **Execution Window** – Complete missions, log all actions, and resolve escalations within SLA.
3. **Assessment Report** – Aggregate findings, quantify performance against goals, and secure sign-off to scale or iterate.
