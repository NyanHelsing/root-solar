# Epic: Simulation Scenario Builder

## Summary
Create an interactive interface for strategists to configure scenarios, adjust parameters, and compare alternative futures before committing to governance changes.

## Deliverables
- Scenario configuration UI with parameter sliders, presets, and saved scenario management.
- Versioning and collaboration features allowing teams to share scenarios and comment on assumptions.
- Integration with model APIs to trigger simulations and stream progress updates to the client.

## Key Dependencies
- Simulation model core with stable API endpoints.
- UX design assets focusing on complex control surfaces and data visualization needs.
- Authentication/authorization logic ensuring only approved strategists can run high-impact scenarios.

## Milestones & Exit Criteria
1. **UX Prototype** – Conduct usability tests with governance stakeholders; refine parameter layout and flows.
2. **Functional Beta** – Scenario builder wired to staging models; capture instrumentation on usage patterns.
3. **Launch Readiness** – Implement guardrails for run quotas and cost controls; achieve ≥80% satisfaction in pilot surveys.
