# Epic: Cohort API Platform

## Summary
Expose cohort lifecycle management through TRPC endpoints so agents and stewards can create cohorts, enroll members, assign tasks, and report outcomes programmatically.

## Deliverables
- TRPC procedures for cohort creation, membership management, task assignment, and status reporting.
- Authentication and authorization mechanics that differentiate agents, stewards, and observers.
- API documentation and integration guides for target agent platforms.

## Key Dependencies
- Cohort schema layer delivering stable IDs and validation rules.
- Security review to define scopes, rate limits, and audit requirements.
- Developer relations support to produce examples and SDK updates.

## Milestones & Exit Criteria
1. **Endpoint Design** – API contracts reviewed with agent platform SMEs; mock server available for testing.
2. **Functional Beta** – Endpoints live in staging; reference agent successfully executes end-to-end mission flow.
3. **Production Launch** – ≥90% of cohort interactions handled via APIs with monitoring and alerting in place.
