# Epic: Credential Verification Layer

## Summary
Expose verification APIs and SDKs that allow internal teams and external partners to confirm credential authenticity without leaking sensitive data.

## Deliverables
- Public verification endpoint supporting DID resolution or signature validation flows.
- Client libraries/examples demonstrating verification in TypeScript and Python.
- Rate limiting, caching, and abuse detection protections for the verification service.

## Key Dependencies
- Issuer service delivering signed credential artifacts with stable schemas.
- Security review of API authentication, response payloads, and logging.
- Documentation resources to craft clear developer guides and reference material.

## Milestones & Exit Criteria
1. **API Draft** – Publish OpenAPI/TypeScript definitions; gather feedback from partner engineers.
2. **Beta Access** – Enable sandbox verification for select partners; collect latency and reliability metrics.
3. **GA Release** – Achieve ≥99.5% success rate on verification requests over four weeks with support SLAs in place.
