# Consensus Simulation Lab

## Vision
Give strategists a sandbox where they can simulate proposed axioms, sentiment adjustments, or policy interventions before pushing them live. The lab models behavioral pathways, highlights risk pockets, and projects long-tail network effects so leaders can iterate safely.

## Why It Matters
- Reduces the blast radius of governance changes by stress-testing them against realistic adoption scenarios.
- Encourages evidence-based iteration, replacing gut feel with probabilistic forecasts anchored in actual sentiment data.
- Turns root.solar into a strategic planning oracle that organizations consult ahead of mission-critical decisions.

## Potential Ripple Effects
- Generates shareable scenario narratives that help partners align on action plans without meeting fatigue.
- Powers a new class of tooling where civic platforms or enterprise PMOs hook into the lab for cross-domain scenario analysis.
- Captures simulation telemetry that trains future models to predict cultural resonance for novel axioms.

## Activation Signals
- Parameterized runs that adjust participation rates, sentiment elasticity, and external shocks.
- Visualizations that animate consensus diffusion over time, spotlighting where friction or momentum emerges.
- Exportable reports that document assumptions, confidence intervals, and recommended next steps.
