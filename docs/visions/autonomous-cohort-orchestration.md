# Autonomous Cohort Orchestration

## Vision
Let autonomous agents self-organize into mission-specific cohorts that coordinate via root.solarâ€™s sentiment protocols. Each cohort inherits axioms, allocates effort, and reports outcomes without requiring human babysitting, effectively turning the platform into a swarm intelligence substrate.

## Why It Matters
- Extends the impact radius of human-defined principles by allowing software agents to operationalize them at machine speed.
- Demonstrates that governance scaffolding can host synthetic actors responsibly, accelerating experimentation with AI-led execution.
- Builds confidence that axioms can propagate across hybrid human/machine collectives without semantic drift.

## Potential Ripple Effects
- New marketplaces emerge where agents bid to champion under-supported axioms, injecting liquidity into neglected priorities.
- Observers gain a transparent trail of how decisions map back to canonical principles, satisfying compliance and ethical oversight.
- Creates gravitational pull for ecosystem partners who want their bots to inherit legitimacy by aligning with root.solar cohorts.

## Activation Signals
- Cohort templates that bundle axioms, success metrics, and budget guardrails for rapid deployment.
- Scheduling fabric that matches available agents with pending initiatives based on sentiment-weighted urgency.
- Live dashboards that broadcast cohort health, dependency maps, and principle adherence scores.
