# Reputation and Credentialing Ledger

## Vision
Issue verifiable credentials that encode how beings contribute to the canon—who authored axioms, who defended them during conflict, who stewarded sentiment during volatility. The ledger becomes the proof-of-contribution layer that powers reputation-aware coordination across the network.

## Why It Matters
- Provides durable recognition for invisible labor, incentivizing long-term stewardship instead of drive-by engagement.
- Allows partner systems to weight votes, budgets, or responsibilities based on demonstrated commitment to shared principles.
- Establishes a transparent audit trail that deters manipulation while rewarding constructive dissent.

## Potential Ripple Effects
- Supports portable identities that carry root.solar reputation into allied protocols, boosting interoperability.
- Encourages new economic primitives—grants, retroactive rewards, or service credits—anchored in credentialed impact.
- Signals to regulators and institutions that principle-driven networks can self-govern with accountability baked in.

## Activation Signals
- Credential schemas covering authorship, mediation, curation, and sentiment reliability.
- Verification APIs that let external tools validate credentials without exposing sensitive personal data.
- Dynamic badges inside the client that highlight trusted guides, emerging leaders, and accomplished agents.
