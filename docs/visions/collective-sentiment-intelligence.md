# Collective Sentiment Intelligence

## Vision
Transform the raw priority allocations across beings into an adaptive intelligence layer that reveals emergent consensus before it hardens into doctrine. By synthesizing sentiment telemetry, trend deltas, and correlation graphs, we can help every participant feel the pulse of the network and respond while intent is still malleable.

## Why It Matters
- Converts passive data exhaust into strategic foresight for coordinators and autonomous agents.
- Surfaces latent alignment pockets so coalitions can form around compatible axioms without central orchestration.
- Creates an always-on feedback loop that teaches the system how to listen and recalibrate in real time.

## Potential Ripple Effects
- Unlocks recommendation streams that nudge beings toward neglected axioms, spreading cognitive load across the network.
- Establishes the analytic backbone for performance-triggered governance, where sentiment thresholds activate policy execution.
- Encourages external platforms to plug in and enrich the sentiment graph, compounding network effects as more observers become contributors.

## Activation Signals
- Aggregated heatmaps that expose which axiom clusters are gaining or losing gravity.
- Predictive alerts that flag when sentiment trajectories imply upcoming conflicts or catalytic alignment.
- API hooks that allow partner systems to subscribe to consensus telemetry and co-create interventions.
