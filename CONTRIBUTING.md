## Before You Start
- Read the [Center of Excellence](docs/coe/index.md) to understand architecture, messaging, and package patterns.
- Review the [Styleguide](STYLEGUIDE.md) for formatting, TypeScript strictness, and SCSS conventions.
- Check the [Roadmap Horizons](docs/roadmap/horizon.md) and relevant [Initiatives](docs/initiatives) to avoid duplicating ongoing work.

## Development Workflow
